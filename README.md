# About the project #

The main outcome of the project is the BFG Toolkit, a set of reusable components that facilitate the development of accessible games for blind users in Android. The BFG Toolkit is being developed following an agile, iterative and incremental methodology, building on the analysis of accessibility requirements  of different games.

At the moment 3 games have been developed using the BFG Toolkit: Accesible Minesweeper, Accessible Golf and Zarodnik. All three games are freely available for download from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=e-UCM).

The Applications' source code and the BFG Toolkit can be downloaded from this repository.

# Get Started with the BFG Toolkit #

## Prerrequisites ##

If you want to download the code, build and try out BFG Toolkit on your own, you should:

  1. **Install the Java SDK version 1.5 or later.** If necessary, download and install the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) for your platform.
  1. **Install Eclipse.** We recommend you to use Eclipse 3.7.0 or later.
  1. **Install Android SDK and ADT plugin for Eclipse:** If you aren't familiar with Android Development you can read more about it on [Android developers site](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
    * **Install the Git plugin for Eclipse:** We used the [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/) project plug-in to download the code from google code git repository. If you are familiar with eclipse, you can directly use the update URL  http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates to install the plugin.
    * **[Download](http://code.google.com/p/blind-faith-games/downloads/detail?name=BFG%20Toolkit.7z&can=2&q=) and unzip the project**. The BFG Toolkit doesn't have an installer application. All the files you need to run and use it are located in the extracted directory.

In addition, you can [download](http://blind-faith-games.googlecode.com/files/Games.7z) and import all the game projects. Only you have to unzip them on the same folder as the BFG Toolkit.
